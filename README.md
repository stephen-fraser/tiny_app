## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).

- If the server is running successfully, the message 'TinyApp listening on port 8080!' will appear in your terminal
- Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
- You should be directed to the login page where you can proceed to login or select register to register as a new user
- From there you can create new tiny urls 
- A user is in control of their tiny urls and are the only ones that can edit/delete them
- Since tiny urls are meant for sharing, anyone can travel to through http://localhost:8080/u/${tinyURL}
